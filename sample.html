    <h1>Welcome to HTML!</h1>

    <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create 
and structure content for web pages. It works by using a series of tags and 
elements to define different parts of a page, such as headings, paragraphs, 
images, links, tables, and lists. Browsers read HTML code and display the 
content in a structured way for users to see and interact with. While 
HTML defines the structure and meaning of content, it is often used 
alongside CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity. Without HTML, 
web pages would have no organized structure, making it 
the foundation of all websites on the internet.</p>
